# Image builder

From here are building Openstack components' container images (LOCI, but not only) with CI/CD pipelines. 

Some parts were adopted from Vexxhost's Atmosphere (https://github.com/vexxhost/atmosphere). 

# TODO

We probably don't need cmd and internal directories as they are specific for Veexhost deployment but we 
need more generic builds. We added them just have working PoC builder as a good start...
